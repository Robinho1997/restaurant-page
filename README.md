# restaurant-page

https://robinho1997.github.io/restaurant-page/

I built an simple restaurant homepage by manipulating the DOM.

The whole content of this website is generated by Javascript alone.

Also for the first Time i used webpacks and modules to build this project cleaner.

For styling I used a separate CSS file.
